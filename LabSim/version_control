## Version Control

-Final version will be Solution 1.0.0, probably

-Major iterations can be marked down in the second digit, e.g. 0.1.1, 0.2.1 etc.

-Minor iterations on third

-Consider it a major iteration when completing a set task on the Trello board, minor when it's a part of the trello board tasks like spawning the ball, etc.

-It'd be good to provide a changelog attached with each version with what changes you made
